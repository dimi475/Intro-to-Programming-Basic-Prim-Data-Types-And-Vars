//Write a program that safely compares floating-point numbers (double) with precision eps = 0.000001. Note that we cannot directly compare two floating-point numbers a and b by a==b because of the nature of the floating-point arithmetic. Therefore, we assume two numbers are equal if they are more closely to each other than a fixed constant eps.//

        double eps = 0.000001;
        
//conditional statement used to compare floating point values//
